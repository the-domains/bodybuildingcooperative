            <title><![CDATA[SUPPORT SUSTAINABLE PRACTICES]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>SUPPORT SUSTAINABLE PRACTICES</h1><p>We live on Vancouver Island- so we are inidated with sustainbility messages everywhere we go. We know 30% of climate change is related to our food  system, and we know supplements sourced or produced with cheap GMO corn, soy, and wheat are not exactly helping. Being from Canada, we also believe its best we don’t inject the very cows we get our milk from with antibiotics and hormones. Maybe thats just us- but that doesnt sound very good for humans or the environment.</p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Do you really need fancy flavours, fillers, or packaging? Probably not. Do you really need a professional athlete on the cover of a product to convince you to buy it? That’s always cool, but again- probably not. So what do you need? You, like us, want a supplement product that is first and foremost effective, next environmentally friendly, and finally low-cost. Knowing this, we have sourced our core supplements from the best manufacturers, inputs, and companies.  Also since we have minimal costs as a cooperative, we can bring these products to you for a fraction of the cost.</p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Sharing Is Caring]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Sharing Is Caring</h1><h2>Create a unique business model that shares success amongst its members</h2><p>We are no different  than you. We too  struggle paying for necessary supplements, school fees, and beer.  That is why we too, are part of the cooperative. We are three college roommates, and more importantly regular dudes who love pumping iron but understand the costs associated with constantly working on our bodies. That is why we created a company to help deliver high quality supplements for a fraction of the cost using an innovative and unique business model developed at the University Of Victoria. Every successive member contributes to a greater collective buying power which means more savings for everyone. That is the founding idea and guiding principle. We don’t want to sleep on piles of cash like that scene in Breaking Bad, we just want to help provide a necessary service through a novel channel- a cooperative. We want to make it as easy as possible, as helpful as possible, and as pleasurable as possible so that you tell your friends. The more people we can get on board, the better it is for everyone, that is why we belong to it, and we think you should to.</p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Our Creatine is formulated as creatine- HCL. While we believe good old creatine monohydrate is just as effective, we used an HCL salt because it requires a fraction of the dose to get the same results. This means less material costs, and more room for us to manuever on quality, and cost to consumer.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Our Protein is from New Zealand, probably the most agriculturally advanced nation in the world. There, they feed their cows grass and water, the way mother nature intended. Not a bucket of grain. Moreover, the New Zealand government mandates that all dairy products are to be free of chemical residue, hormones and antibiotics. This is one of the highest quality protein powders you can buy.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Our ZMA is the original formula created by BALCO labs in the 90s. We haven’t added anything, and we haven’t taken anything out. It is composed of the original strictly vitamins and minerals. Why? Because it is the only formula scientifically studied and anything else just taking shots in the dark.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Our Omega 3 Fish Oil is sourced from the Ocean. Now we all know the ocean is a little f*cked up in 2013. So we made sure to source our fish oil from fish with some of the lowest levels of toxins: anchovies and mackeral. See Salmon eat other fish, so do Tuna fish, and predators like that often take on the chemicals of their prey. We as humans are unfortunately are no different. That is why we source our Fish Oil from tiny little fish swimming in our clean canadian waters. And that is why we too, have to be sure we consume prey that is chemical free.</p>]]></description>
