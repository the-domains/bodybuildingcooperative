# Our Story

##### from a simple question to an even simpler answer...

While studying together at the University of Victoria- Adam Kammer (Art Major), Scott Peris (Business Major), and Sean Holler (Political Science Major) discussed over dinner why nutritional supplements were so damn expensive. They had always assumed it was because companies sourced the highest quality ingriedents, had large research and development budgets and vast teams of employees. What they found was that this was almost never the case. The bulk of money was actually spent on advertising, marketing strategies, and signing professional athletes. Soon after discussing it, an idea took hold. Over more beer at their favourite restaurant Bin 4, a business model developed: they could use collective buying power to reduce material cost, design sophisticated labels themselves, assemble packages of products that work syngergistically together and source the product from the exact companies overspending on advertising. Moreover it would be sold online, delivered anywhere in the world, and keep more money in everyones pockets.
