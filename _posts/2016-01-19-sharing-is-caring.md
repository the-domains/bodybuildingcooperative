# Sharing Is Caring

##### Create a unique business model that shares success amongst its members

We are no different  than you. We too  struggle paying for necessary supplements, school fees, and beer.  That is why we too, are part of the cooperative. We are three college roommates, and more importantly regular dudes who love pumping iron but understand the costs associated with constantly working on our bodies. That is why we created a company to help deliver high quality supplements for a fraction of the cost using an innovative and unique business model developed at the University Of Victoria. Every successive member contributes to a greater collective buying power which means more savings for everyone. That is the founding idea and guiding principle. We don't want to sleep on piles of cash like that scene in Breaking Bad, we just want to help provide a necessary service through a novel channel- a cooperative. We want to make it as easy as possible, as helpful as possible, and as pleasurable as possible so that you tell your friends. The more people we can get on board, the better it is for everyone, that is why we belong to it, and we think you should to.
