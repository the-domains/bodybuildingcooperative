# SUPPORT SUSTAINABLE PRACTICES

We live on Vancouver Island- so we are inidated with sustainbility messages everywhere we go. We know 30% of climate change is related to our food  system, and we know supplements sourced or produced with cheap GMO corn, soy, and wheat are not exactly helping. Being from Canada, we also believe its best we don't inject the very cows we get our milk from with antibiotics and hormones. Maybe thats just us- but that doesnt sound very good for humans or the environment.

Thats why we source our protein from New Zealand, a country with similar agricultural standards, and a high degree of respect for the environment.

While it may travel farther to get here, we believe it is important to divert capital to the producers doing it right and help funnel it away from the ones doing it wrong.

On top of sourcing our products from envrionmentally friendly inputs, we give 5% of our montly proceeds to Nature Conservancy Canada. This charity is the country's largest national land conservation organization. Since 1962, it has helped protect more than 2.6 million acres (1 million hectares) across the country. That is why on our label you will see not just our logo, but theirs as well.

Moreover, our products are packed in plastic bags and not large vaceous tubs. We dont believe in empty space. Not in the product container or the box it ships in. This allows us to cut down on our packaging and shipping costs, so that we can pass the savings on to both you and the environment.

With this, we believe The Bodybuilding Cooperative proves that it is possible to source and deliver the highest quality supplements without sacrificing your wallet or the health of the environment.
