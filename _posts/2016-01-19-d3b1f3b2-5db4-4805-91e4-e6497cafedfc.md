#### Omega 3 Fish Oil

Our Omega 3 Fish Oil is sourced from the Ocean. Now we all know the ocean is a little f\*cked up in 2013\. So we made sure to source our fish oil from fish with some of the lowest levels of toxins: anchovies and mackeral. See Salmon eat other fish, so do Tuna fish, and predators like that often take on the chemicals of their prey. We as humans are unfortunately are no different. That is why we source our Fish Oil from tiny little fish swimming in our clean canadian waters. And that is why we too, have to be sure we consume prey that is chemical free.
