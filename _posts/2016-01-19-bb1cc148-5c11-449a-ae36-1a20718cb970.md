#### Protein

Our Protein is from New Zealand, probably the most agriculturally advanced nation in the world. There, they feed their cows grass and water, the way mother nature intended. Not a bucket of grain. Moreover, the New Zealand government mandates that all dairy products are to be free of chemical residue, hormones and antibiotics. This is one of the highest quality protein powders you can buy.
