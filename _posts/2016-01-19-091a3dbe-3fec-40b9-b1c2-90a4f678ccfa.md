#### Creatine

Our Creatine is formulated as creatine- HCL. While we believe good old creatine monohydrate is just as effective, we used an HCL salt because it requires a fraction of the dose to get the same results. This means less material costs, and more room for us to manuever on quality, and cost to consumer.
